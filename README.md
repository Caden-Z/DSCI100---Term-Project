# Introduction
Many studies conduct research about the effect of video games on the youth, and whether we should be concerned regarding how often young kids interact with them. Rehbein and Baier’s (2013) study highlights the issue of video games becoming addictive during youth, discussing the problematic use of video games and specific risk factors, and how these may correlate to gaining a gaming addiction. However, Witt et al. (2011) discuss if personality and self-esteem have an effect on video games and overall internet use. While they find there is a relationship, they also find that youth increase internet usage as they develop but decrease the amount of time they spend playing video games. Both studies shine light on the question of youth and video games, providing a basis as to our research question: how many hours does a player contribute to a video game given their age?

The Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI) at the University of British Columbia has begun a project to examine the relationship between video games like Minecraft, and the power of artificial intelligence. We can utilize its data regarding the age of players and how many hours they contribute to the game, to discover if we can predict whether players of a certain age will play more or less. The dataset used to answer our question is the players dataset, which involves information about the players’ characteristics. The dataset includes the following information such as a player’s experience level (“veteran” as the most experienced with Minecraft and “beginner” as the least), whether a player is subscribed, a player’s encrypted email, the total amount of hours played, the player’s nickname, the player’s gender, and the player’s age. A model can thus be made using the age and playing hours data to examine if a relationship is present and thus, if we can predict a player’s play time from how old they are.
